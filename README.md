 #HealthGuard-Hypertension-Risk-Predictor-System
 

# Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of hypertension in individuals based on various health-related features. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze input data and provide predictions regarding the likelihood of an individual developing hypertension.

# Features
- Importing necessary libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
- Importing and handling the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics and distributions of variables.
- Data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.
- Training and evaluating multiple classification algorithms for hypertension risk prediction, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
- Assessing model performance using accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Saving trained models for future use.
- #Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to input their health data and receive predictions regarding hypertension risk.



# Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Joblib, Tkinter
